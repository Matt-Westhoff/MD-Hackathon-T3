# MD-Hackathon-T3
A repository for work as part of the 2022 MD hackathon week

# Initial plan
We are using the dataset 'Bike Rack Use By Stop By Fiscal Week'.
The point of the project is to get familiar with working in Git, not necessarily create a polished product. Let's focus first on a minimum viable product before seeing if we can achieve more.
Description of metadata and some summary statistics (totals, means) should be relatively straightforward.
The visualisation component is the interesting one. We can look at bike rack use from both a time series and geospatial perspective.
If we produce a map to visualise, one idea is to make each rack a circle, and to have the circles' sizes proportional to their use.
Let's see what we can do first before reconvening on Friday.
